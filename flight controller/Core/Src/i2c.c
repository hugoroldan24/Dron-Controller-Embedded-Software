 *@brief																					   *
 *Interrupt-driven I2C1 master driver that implements multi-byte read/write transactions via   *
 *a small state machine. Configures PB6/PB7 for I2C AF, sets Fast-mode timing (400 kHz),	   *
 *and handles START/ADDR/TXE/RXNE/BTF events in I2C1_EV_IRQHandler. The driver exposes		   *
 *i2c1_perform_action() to start a transaction; callbacks (start, address_sent, DR_empty,	   *
 *RX_ready, STOP_TX) progress the state machine and transfer data via shared volatile buffers  *
 *and flags.																		 		   *
